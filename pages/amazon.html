          <h2>Facts About the Ecuadorian Amazon</h2>
          <h3>1. It is Home to Remarkable Biodiversity </h3>
          <p>The Amazon Basin, and the Ecuadorian Amazon in particular, is home to truly astounding biodiversity: the Yasuní Biosphere Reserve is believed by many to be home to the most diverse set of species on the Earth. In the Ecuadorian Amazon, you will find: 800 species of fish, including three sorts of piranhas 350 Species of reptiles, including anacondas and iguanas More than 300 species of mammals, including monkeys and jaguars Thousands of species of plants and trees Thousands of species of insects: one acre of rainforest may be home to 70,000 species of insect!</p>

          <h3>2. It has a Fascinating History</h3>
          <p>Did you know that the Amazon River was discovered from Ecuador? It’s true. In 1541, a group of Spanish conquistadors left Quito in search of the legendary city of El Dorado. A year later, a small group led by Francisco de Orellana got split off from this large expedition. Orellana and his men eventually found the Amazon River, which they followed hundreds of miles to the Atlantic Ocean. Along the way, they saw some fierce native warrior women and named the river “Amazon” after them.</p>

          <h3>3. There are Uncontacted Tribes There</h3>
          <p>Ecuador’s Amazon Region is home to two small tribes of people: the Taromenane and the Tagaeri. There are only a handful of individuals left, and the tribes live in deliberate isolation, eschewing all contact with the modern world. Both tribes live within the borders of the Yasuní National Park, where their rights – including the right to be left alone – are protected by Ecuador’s constitution.</p>

          <h3>4. The National Parks are Amazing</h3>
          <p>The Yasuní National Park and Biosphere Reserve is only the best-known of Ecuador’s National Parks in the Amazon Region. In addition to Yasuní, other National Parks such as Sumaco Napo-Galeras, Cayambe-Coca and Llanganates all protect parts of the Ecuadorian Amazon. In addition, there are other areas which, although not technically national parks, are safe havens for wildlife, such as the Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve. Together, these protected areas ensure that Ecuador’s wildlife will continue to thrive for future generations.</p>
